Project Description
This project implements a Blockchain-based Verification System for Academic Certificates combined with e-Signing functionality. The goal is to provide a secure, immutable, and decentralized way to verify the authenticity of academic certificates, while also allowing for digital signing of certificates using blockchain technology.

By utilizing blockchain's core features (decentralization, immutability, and security), this system ensures that certificates cannot be tampered with, and the signing process is transparent and verifiable.

Features:
Blockchain-based Certificate Storage: Store academic certificates as records on the blockchain, ensuring they are tamper-proof.
Digital Signatures: Enable universities or institutions to sign certificates digitally using cryptographic signatures.
Certificate Verification: Allow users to verify the authenticity of certificates by checking the blockchain record.
Secure Communication: Ensure that certificates are only signed by the authorized entities using secure private keys.
Technologies Used
Python: The main programming language used for the blockchain and digital signature logic.
Blockchain: A custom implementation of a blockchain that stores and verifies academic certificate data.
Cryptography (ECDSA): Used for generating and verifying digital signatures.
SQLite: Optional database for storing additional metadata or logs for certificates.
Flask (optional): For creating a RESTful API for certificate verification (if you want to create a web interface).
